# Score Keeper App
https://19marius93.github.io/score-keeper/

This is a Score Keeper app that I've made using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>Bulma</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

<strong>Skills used:</strong>

<strong>HTML:</strong> I've used semantic elements to make it more comprehensible, the layout and styling of the page was achieved using <strong>Bulma</strong>

<strong>JavaScript:</strong> I've declared <strong>variables</strong> and used <strong>query selectors</strong> methods to match the <em>HTML</em> elements to the <em>specified selectors</em>. With the help of <strong>event listeners</strong> I was able to give <em>functionality</em> to the <em>button</em> elements and to make the necessary <em>changes</em>, e.g <em>when a player chooses the value to play to</em>. To <em>update</em> the score, I've used a <strong>function</strong> which takes two <strong>parameters</strong> and uses <strong>if</strong> statements to <em>execute</em> a certain <em>block of code</em>, if the specified <em>condition is true</em>. To <em>reset</em> the game, I've delcared a <strong>function</strong> using <strong>reset()</strong> method and a <strong>for loop</strong>, to reset the controls to their <em>default property values</em>
